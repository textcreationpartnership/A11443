            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>So that although it could be ſhewed that your faith had bene alwaies in the world (as it was not) yet in that (if at all it were) it lay hydden,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> it could not be the faith of Christes true Church, which neuer ceaſed to be a <hi>City built vpon a hil which can not be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

            <p>I choſe at this tyme to intreat with al ſober Protestants the rather by your perſon (M. D. Parker) becauſe I haue heard of ſo much good nature in your worſhippe, that it was not vnlike, but he woulde vouteſafe to heare what ſo euer ſhould be reaſonably ſaid, ſpecially touching Gods worde, and the practiſe of the primatiue Churche, of which pointes my chiefe talke ſhalbe at this tyme.</p>
            <p>Many men haue laboured to geue diuerſe Signes and Markes of the true Church, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it being ones knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, al other controuerſies may geue place to <hi>the pillor and ſure ſtay of truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> But that it may appear to them, who do not willingly ſtop their eares against the truth, what notable aduantage the Catholiks haue ouer and aboue the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<pb facs="tcp:2538:5"/> in this behalf: I wil ſhew the truth of our Churche to be ſo ſafe and clere, that hitherto it was not poſsible for the Proteſtants themſelues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe any ſuch marke or ſigne of a true Churche, the which doth not much rather make for vs, then for them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gods vvord is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient mark of the true Church.</note>They teach <hi>Gods word</hi> to be the chiefe mark, whereby the true Church may be knowen, which yet can not wel be ſo, becauſe the marke whereby an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is knowen, ought it ſelfe to be moſt exactly knowen, whereas we are not agreed, what Gods woorde is. For ſome call onely <hi>the writen letter and the meaning thereof,</hi> Gods woorde: others thinck many things to be Gods woorde, which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly writen, but are <hi>reuealed from God to the Church by the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2 Heb. 8. &amp; 10. 2. Cor. 3.</note> and by the holy ghoſt, who hath writen <hi>Gods lawes in our harts, and there hath impri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Alſo we are not agreed vppon the writen woorde of God, becauſe the Protestantes doe not admitte ſo many bookes of the olde Testament, as the Catholikes doe. Thirdly the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe bookes which we are agreed vppon, is altogether in queſtion betwen vs. How then can that be a mark ſufficient to ſhew an other thing to vs, which it ſelf is not ſufficientlie knowen of vs? All which reaſons notwithſtanding, the confidence of our cauſe is ſuch, that I may graunt the woorde of God (what ſoeuer it be) to be a ſufficient marke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Gods Churche may be knowen. And then I ſay, that euerie way Gods word ſtandeth more on our ſyde, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs.</p>

               <p>The Catholiques beleue, that the Biſhop of Rome, ſitting in S. Peters Chaier is, by the appointment of Chriſt himſelf, the chief Paſtour of the whole militant Church, whoſe voice euery ſheepe ought to hearken vnto.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants on the other ſide denie, not only the Supremacie of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2538:37"/> Biſhop of Rome, nor onlie the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of S. Peter: but alſo they affirme, that there is no Primacie, nor any one chief gouernment in the Church at al. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Therefore the first Question muſt be, whether it be againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Word of God or no, that there ſhoulde be in his Church any Primacie or chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is, whether S. Peter had the ſaid Primacie, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third, whether the Biſhop of Rome had it after S. Peter.</p>
               <p>Concerning S. Peter, we fal againe into diuers new queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as it ſhal now appeare.</p>
               <p>When Simon the ſonne of Iona was firſt brought vnto Christ by his brother Andrew, Ieſus loking vpon him, ſaid: <hi>Thou art Simon the ſonne of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioan. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>thou ſhalt be called Cephas, the vvhich by interpretation is Peter,</hi> that is to ſay, a ſtone or a rocke. Here is the promiſe made, that Simon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2538:37"/> ſhalbe called Peter, which name is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued of a rocke or ſtone. Verelie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhal occupie that place in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the frame of Chriſtes militant Church, the which a ſtone occupieth in holding vp the houſe which is built vpon it. And when it pleaſed Chriſt to choſe vnto him his twelue Apoſtles, then he gaue the ſaid name vnto Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>ſurnaming him, Peter.</hi> Thirdly,<note place="margin">Mar. 3. Luc. 6.</note> when Simon hauing the Godhead of Chriſt reuealed to him from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had confeſſed the ſame, ſaying:<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art Chriſt the ſon of the liuing God:</hi> then Ieſus anſwering, ſaid vnto him (alluding to his new name,<note place="margin">Ioan. 21.</note> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon thereof) <hi>And I ſaye vnto thee, that thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke vvil I build my Church, and the gates of hel ſhal not preuaile againſt it. And to thee I wil geue the Keies of the kingdome of heauen. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou ſhalt bind vpon the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2538:38"/> earth, it ſhalbe bound alſo in the heauens: And vvhatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe vpon the earth, it ſhals be looſed alſo in the heauens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe wordes both the promiſe of Chriſt was fufilled, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the reaſon of the promiſe was alſo declared, concerning the new name, which was before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. Neither do our aduerſaries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie theſe points, as I ſuppoſe. But the Catholiques reaſon farther vpon this place, in this wiſe: The name of Peter, which is deriued of a rock or of a ſtone, was no ſoner geuen to Simon, but alſo a new promiſe was made,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> that <hi>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Rocke Chriſt would builde his Church.</hi> Now the Catholikes doe ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf is here called this <hi>rock,</hi> and that Chriſt promiſed to build his Church <hi>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</hi> And becauſe the building of Chriſtes church varieth not after his Goſpel once planted, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies like it ſelf, the Catholikes beleue and teach, that when S. Peter died, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Neither onely among brethren, but euen among fellow ſeruaunts there is found a certaine Superioritie, which is nothing els but that power, which it pleaſeth the chief Lord to geue to ſome one of his ſeruaunts ouer al the rest.

               </p>
               <p>Here I aſke whether the King or Emperour, who is chriſtened, be Peters ſheep or no? If he be not, he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not aboue the Church, but he is not at all of the Churche. If he be his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2538:71"/> ſheepe, then I ſay boldly, that as it is againſt the law of nature (which neuer can be wholie changed) for a ſhepe to rule his ſhepheard (in anie manner of ſuch ſort, wherein he is the ſhepheard) euen ſo it is vtterly impoſsible for anie King or Prince to be in anie reſpect of Eccleſiastical gouernment, aboue his own paſtour, who ſoeuer he be for the time.</p>
               <p>And yet farther to make this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more plaine, be it that a Chriſtian King doth take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the ſupreame gouernment in Eccleſiaſtical matters. What if a biſhop being called before him,<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>32.</hi> &amp; ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> ſay boldlie (as S.

But as for the ordering and gouerning of my biſhoprike, I will not yeld it to you, becauſe Chriſt (and not your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie) committed the ſame to me: what could that Chriſtian King doe to that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2538:71"/> biſhop more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Nero or Traian might haue done? Could he excommunicate him by his roial power? M. Horn will not ſay ſo. What is it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he could doe? might he putte him in priſon? ſo might Nero, and alſo the great Turk.</p>
               <p>By this meane it appeareth, that the King be he neuer ſo much chriſtened, hath yet no power ouer the Biſshops ſoule.

               <p>It is farther to be conſidered, that the literal ſenſe being once agreed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there lyeth hidden in that ſenſe manie times an other more profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſenſe alſo, the which is not directly and plainly vttered, but it is inferred and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the force of argument.

               <p>But that in theſe words there lyeth hidden a ſtrong argument, to proue the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: by that, I ſay, dependeth of the literal ſenſe alſo, but not ſuch as is ſene ſtraight waies, but onlie it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first is, that the Church is mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be built <hi>vpon Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is, that euery Diſciple of Chriſt is the rock whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church is built a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that being the ſenſe of Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Origenes in Math.</note> is only ſpirituall, and therefore of no great force to proue any thing by.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth and perfit ſenſe is, that Peter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his office in Gods Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,<note place="margin">Ioan 1. Math. 16. Ioan. 21.</note> that is to ſay, through the promiſe of Chriſt which is paſt, and the faithful confeſsion of his godhead, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently made, and the power of feedi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ock vpon which the Church is built.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſenſe can not be all the whole ſenſe, becauſe then all the other three ſenſes were void. For if the Church be meant to be only built vpon Chriſt then is the Church built neither vpon the faith of Peter nor vpon Peter himſelf, nor vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any diſciple of Christ.</p>
               <p>Againe the word <hi>(thou)</hi> which goeth before doth not wel agree with Chriſt, but only with Peter: Neither doth the word, <hi>I wil build,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">aedificabo</note> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth after, well agree with Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. For it were not properly ſaied at Ceſarea where Chriſt then was, <hi>I will build my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Concerning the ſecond ſenſe, no Diſciple of Christ is there literallie either ſpoken vnto, or ſpoken of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Simon the Sonne of Iona.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſenſe of Origen hath no
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2538:88"/> ſufficient ground in the letter of Gods word.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie the faith, which Peter hath confeſſed, is not the onlie rocke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Church ſhalbe built. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it had ben built, vpon the faith of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt before this tyme.<note place="margin">Ioan. 1.</note> Againe ſeing the ſaid faith hath bene already confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Peter himſelf ſaying: <hi>Thou art Chriſt the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of the liuing God,</hi> to what purpoſe is the building yet alſo differred? Why is it ſaid, <hi>I will build my Church vpon this Rocke,</hi> and not rather, I haue built it, or I do build it vpon this Rocke?</p>
               <p>For if two things only are neceſſary, the one, which maie be the Rocke or foundation, which is nowe ſaid to be faith, the other, which is the building of the Church vpon that Kocke: ſeing the foundation is alreadie laid, in that the faith is confeſſed: And ſeing the Church is preſent (for Chriſt euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had a Church of his owne) why is the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2538:88"/> building yet putte of, vntill an other tyme, but that there is an other thing beſyde faith requiſite to the ſame buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?</p>
               <p>But if (as the very truth is) Peter himſelfe, concerning his office, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced this Rock, and that not only in reſpect of his faith (although it be a very principal point) but alſo in reſpect both of the promiſe paſt, wherein it was ſaid <hi>(thow ſhall be called Peter)</hi> and of the authoritie of feeding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſheepe, which is to come:<note place="margin">Ioan. 1. &amp; 21.</note> then all abſurdities are auoided, and all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer truthes are perfitlie conteined in this laſt ſenſe.</p>
               <p>For if Peter be this rock, then Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who made Peter to be this Rocke, is much more proued thereby to be the rock himſelf. for the geuer of any hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly power, hath much more that power in himſelfe, then he that receaueth it. If Peter be this Rock in reſpect of his confeſsion, then his confeſsion.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:2538:89"/>
               <p>being in himſelf, is alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curring (as a certain rock for his part) vnto the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the Church. If Peter be the Rock, ſeing he was not only a Diſciple, but the captain Diſciple of al that euer were: al other Diſciples, which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Seing then this laſt ſenſe is moſte perfit, and conteineth al the other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not being it ſelfe fully conteined in any of them, out of al controuerſie none other is ſo literal, ſo ful, ſo true, as this, to witte, <hi>that Peter, confeſsing the true faith, with reſpect of ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie, as ſhalbe afterward geuen to him, is this Rocke, wherevpon the Church ſhalbe built.</hi> I wiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iohn Baptiſt is not that kinde of Rock. And the Churche is now promiſed to be builte vppon his confeſsion, who is first made the Rock, and who being the Rock, doth ſtrongly confeſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Remember alſo, that I ſhewed in the former Chapiter, how al the foure ſenſes, which the Fathers geue of the foreſaid wordes <hi>(vpon this Rock I wil build my Church)</hi> are perfitely conteined in this one ſenſe, wherein <hi>the church is promiſed to be built vppon Peter.</hi> For ſo it is proued
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2538:104"/> to be built vppon Christ, becauſe he is ſo vniuerſall a Rocke of the whole Churche, that he maketh Peter a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Rocke of the Militant Church. In Peter is the faith which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, in him are all faithful Diſciples comprehended. But in none other ſenſe al the auncient Fathers interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can be ſaued vpright.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, ſeeing it is cleere, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> to be the Rock, is to be a certain foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Churche (for Christe buildeth his houſe vppon a Rocke) ſith al the Apoſtles are certaine foundaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods beautifull Citie,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. 21.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are alſo certeine Rockes, vppon whiche the Churche is built: how can Peter be denyed to be a Rock and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Churche for his part?</p>
               <p>Now, that his parte doth paſſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mennes partes, I proue it moste euidentlie, becauſe the names of things are tokens of the things them ſelues, and that moste ſpeciallie, when God
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2538:105"/> himſelfe geueth the name, as now he hath done. For yf the thing were not ſo before, as he nameth it, at the least his naming it ſo, maketh it to be that, which he nameth it.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſeing onely Peter after Chriſt beareth the name <hi>of a rocke,</hi> it is out of all question, that the ſaid name is a ſigne of his being the rock in ſome ſuch ſort, as none other Apostle is the rocke. But the faithfull are built vpon the foundation of all the Apoſtles and Prophets (as S. Paul ſaith) and thei are the Church of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.</note> therefore the Church of Chriſt is much more notably built vpon S. Peter aboue all others, becauſe he is the rocke and foundation aboue al others.</p>
               <p>And whereas by the power Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike al the Apoſtles were equal, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly S. Peter is this rock,<note place="margin">Leo ſerm. <hi>2.</hi> de an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſ. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpt.</note> not only as an Apoſtle (wherein he had manie fellowes) but alſo as a chefe biſhop, and as the <hi>primate of all Biſshops and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2538:105"/> Prieſts,</hi> wherin he was pereleſſe, being the head and top of all others in that ſenſe as I ſhal declare hereafter. In the which highe prieſthod only Peter hath a ſucceſſour, who ſitteth in the See of Rome, to continue a Rock for euer: ſith Christes militant Church needeth to be alwaies built vp by viſible preaching and gouernment.</p>
               <p>This my interpretation is not a litle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> fortified by the preuarication of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. For they being at a point to deny, that Peter and his ſucceſſours are this rock, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the milita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church is built, are yet by no meanes agreed, what chiefe ſenſe theſe words <hi>(vpon this rocke I wil build my Church)</hi> ought to haue.<note place="margin">Ievvel in his Reply fol. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>S. Hierome hauing called S. Peter,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ. Ioui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the Apostle of Christ, and the Rock, afterward confeſſeth to Iouinian (who reioyſed to ſee a maried man ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) that, <hi>Super Petrum fundatur Eccleſia.</hi> The Church is built vpon Peter. Adding therevnto: <hi>Licet id ipſum in alio loco ſuper omnes Apoſtolos fiat, &amp; cuncti claues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gni

               <p>Three things are to be noted in this ſentence. First, that the Church is ſo built vpon Peter the Rocke, that <hi>in the ſame place,</hi> where it is built vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Peter, the like is not done vppon the other Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Church is equally fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon al the Apoſtles in an other place,<note place="margin">Ioan. 20.</note> to witte, when they are ſent of Chriſt, as Christ was ſent of his Father,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2538:118"/> to bind or to looſe, and ſo foorth.<note place="margin">Ioan. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>one is choſen head</hi> of the twelue to th'intent ſchiſme may be auoided. A man may ſay: if al be equal,<note place="margin">The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere.</note> How is one head? This ſhall be more fully anſwered hereafter. I ſay for this time. Al twelue as touching the office of the Apoſtleſship, were equal, and all were Rockes and heades of the whole Church. But being conſidered as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Biſshops and Paſtours, wherby they had particular authority to teach ſome here, and ſome there (as now Biſshops doe euery man in his own dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe) ſo, one was their head.</p>
               <p>How can it els be, that S. Hierome ſhuld agree with himſelf? al be equal, and one is the head. Can the head be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers? Or is it not higheſt of al, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d chief of al? We muſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, that alare equal in the office of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apoſtleſhip, but Peter was otherwiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the chief Apoſtle and head in the Biſshoplie power, whiche euery
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2538:119"/> Apoſtle had, beſide the Apoſtolike office, as it ſhal appeare hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it is certain, that S. Hierom writeth:<note place="margin">Hieron. aduerſus Iouin. li. <hi>2</hi>

Hierome ſpeaketh not of the Apoſtles owne choiſe, but of Christes own chooſing, it appeareth euidentlie, when he ſaith afterwarde, that <hi>the good man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Neither did it ſuffiſe, that during the Apostles time onely, ſuch a Rocke and head ſhould be appointed, for ſo muche as the Churche of God, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ended in their time, And their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours in their Biſshoply autoritie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

               <p>S. Auguſtine affirmeth in many places, that S. Peter did repreſent the whole Churche, according to whiche ſenſe he writeth thus:<note place="margin">Epiſt. 165.</note> 
                  <hi>Petro totius Eccleſiae figuram gere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti Dominus ait, ſuper hanc petram aedificabo Eccleſiam meam.</hi> Our Lord ſayth

                  <hi>vnto Peter</hi> bearing the figure of the whole Churche, <hi>Vppon this Rock</hi> I wil build my Churche. So that he geueth this cauſe, why this muche is ſayed to Peter, verely becauſe <hi>Peter beareth the figure of the vvhole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how commeth it to paſſe, that Peter doth bear the figure of the whole Churche? Surely becauſe he is the head and Rocke of the whole. For euerie prince doth beare the figure and as it were the generall perſon of his ſubiectes, and of them who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Charge. For that they all are, as it were, gathered togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and vnited in him alone. And this to be the true meaning of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,<note place="margin">In Ioan. tract. <hi>124</hi>
                  </note> it appeareth euidentlie by his own wordes: <hi>Eccleſiae Petrus Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolus propter Apoſtolatus ſui pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>matum gerebat figurata generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate perſona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Peter the Apostle (by a generalitie which was figured) did

               </p>
               <p>Peter did beare the perſon of the Churche, not as menne cary burthens on their backs, but by a figured genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that is to ſay, as a general officer. For he doth beare their perſons, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie, but figuratiuely. To witte, by interpretation of the Law, and not by real extenſion of his body to be made ſo big as to vphold al thir bodies,<note place="margin">Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata.</note> S.

               <p>For the Lawe interpreteth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the chiefe officer of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weal, to bear the perſon of the ſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weal. And therupon the head being preſent for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, the law worketh, as if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale it ſelfe were preſent, when the head alone is preſent. What was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peters office? <hi>The primacy of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2538:121"/> Apoſtleſhip.</hi> He was firſt and chiefe, <hi>&amp; propter Apoſtolatus ſui pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Propter.</note> and for the primacie of his Apostleſhip he ſignified all his flock in him ſelf alone. ſo that he tooke the keies for al, and was the general Rocke for euery other particular Rocke, and for that primacie of his he bare the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Churche.</p>
               <p>To ſhew yet farther the force of this reaſon, the Reader must conſyder, that firſt, <hi>Peter</hi> is ſaid to be the Rocke, and therein to beare the perſon of the Church <hi>figurata generalitate,</hi> which is to ſay, as if he were in deede the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or the whole myſtical bodie of the Church, which yet he is not, but is only the officer thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondarily a reaſon is geuen, why <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould ſignifie or beare the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the whole Church more then any other. And the cauſe is, <hi>propter Apoſtolatus ſui primatum,</hi> for the primacie of his Apoſtleſhip, that is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2538:121"/> to ſay, becauſe he is chiefe. If this cauſe were not found in S. Auguſtine, the Proteſtants might haue ſome pretenſe to ſay (as they doe) verelie, that Peter was not in deede the rock, nor head, but onlie that he is called ſo, to ſignifie, that the whole Church is built vpon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But now Peter doth not ſignifie the Church to be built vpon Christ, as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a man, nor as he is a faithful ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor as he is an Apoſtle, but as he is <hi>the primate of the Apoſtles, prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Apoſtolatus ſui primatum,</hi> for the primacie of his Apostleſhip. If he be not Primate in deede, he doth not ſignifie that which S. Augustine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</p>
               <p>For all myſtical ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in Gods word be built vpon a real truthe.<note place="margin">Gen. 8.</note> Noë by offering cleane beaſts vpon the altar, did ſignifie the death of Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in deede Noë did offer vppon the altar. Let it be taught to be a feined thing, that Noë did offer thoſe beaſts,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2538:122"/> and that dede of his can not be a figure of Christes death. For that which is not reallie true, is the figure of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſeing the primacie of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the cauſe why he beareth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Church, and why he hath the Church built vpon him, it is not only true, that Peter is <hi>the primate of the Apoſtles,</hi> and therby of the whole Church,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but alſo he is (at the leaſt in the order of nature) <hi>firſt</hi> the primate, before he doth beare the figure of the Church.</p>
               <p>For as if a man do beare the perſon of Gloceſter in the Parleament becauſe he is Burges of that Citie, it is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie true that he is first Burges, before he doe ſo beare that perſon: euen ſo if Peter beare the figure of the Church, <hi>becauſe he is the primate,</hi> he is ſurelie the primate before he beare the general perſon of the Church. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay he is primate before, I meane
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2538:122"/> not in time, but in courſe and order of nature. For firſt Peter is conſidered as made primate, and then we afterward conſider, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his primacy the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Church is layed, although both things be done at once.</p>
               <p>Seing then Peter could not beare this general perſon but only for thoſe, whoſe officer and primate he was, it is euident,<note place="margin">In Ioan. Tract. <hi>12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Saint Peter being the next ſtone in building of the Church, vnto Chriſt, is therefore a Rocke, becauſe he is built immediatlie vppon the Rocke.

               <p>And ſurely it is worth the noting, that where as S. Andrewe came to Chriſt before S.

               <p>But euermore in al theſe varieties, howſoeuer the order of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles be changed, ſeing S.

               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:2538:149"/>
               <p>Which to true the authoritie alſo of the auncient Fathers doth euidentlie conuince.

               </p>
               <p>And conſequentlie therevnto, they call S. Peter commonlie <hi>Principem, Corypheu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, caput, verticem, duce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; os Apoſtolorum,</hi> the prince or chiefe of the Apoſtles, the head, the top, the guide, and the mouth. By which words they declare themſelues to take <hi>primus</hi> the firſt, for <hi>princeps,</hi> the chiefe, and for <hi>maximus</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt (which word S. Hierom alſo vſeth) ſo that the meaning of S. Matthew is: <hi>The chiefe is Simon who is called
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2538:149"/> Peter.</hi> Thus it is euident by the word of God, that Peter being chefeſt, al the Apoſtles be not equal with him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perhaps anie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who is not chiefe, can be equal with him who is chiefe.</p>
               <p>If you aſke,<note place="margin">The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> wherein Peter was chiefe, or what he could doe more then his followes, I ſay, that queſtion alſo is curiouſe. It becometh him, who will obey the Goſpel, to belieue, that S. Peter is the firſt or chiefe as he readeth in the Goſpel, without demaunding why or how he ſhould be chiefe. But yf the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were demaunded humbly, thus I would thincke it might be anſwered.</p>
               <p>In the nature and order of the Apoſtleſhip,<note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere.</note> euery Apostle was wholy equal with all the followes of his owne order. The which is not only true in the Apoſtles, but alſo in Biſhops, in prieſts, in Kings, in Dukes, in Knightes, or in any other ſtate of men. For there is a certain reaſon why a man is either an Apoſtle, or a King, or a duke, the which
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2538:150"/> reaſon muſt nedes be common to all that be of that degree and ſtate.</p>
               <p>But there may be an other thing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident to ſome degree of men, the which although it be not neceſſarie for their being, yet it is neceſſarie for their well being. And ſo whereas of twelue Apoſtles euery one is equal in that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with the other, yet it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for their good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance in peace and vnity,<note place="margin">Optatus lib. <hi>2.</hi> de ſchiſ.

               <p>Thus whereas al the Apoſtles were equal by the nature of their vocation, one was ſet ouer the reſt by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God,<note place="margin">Matth. 10</note> and he was ſo ſet ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he was euen at the firſt choiſe (though that wer not throughly percae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vntil Chriſts reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) made firſt of al, and appointed for moſt of all, that

               </p>
               <p>If then all were equal in office, and yet one was ſet ouer them to kepe vnity, he was not thereby an Apoſtle more then they, but he was greater then they. Not greater in his office, or in his Apostolike power: but greater in his prerogatiue of being head, and of making all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be as one, whiles they were all content to obey him alone, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to make a ſchiſm.</p>
               <p>But now let vs ad to their doctrine an other truthe, which is, that all the

                  <hi>becauſe he ſhall tarie with you, and he ſhalbe in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon it will follow that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in their owne perſons needed no head, but that S. Peter was ſet ouer them, <hi>to geue thereby a forme and a paterne,</hi> that afterward when the perſonal priuilege of the Apoſtles ſhuld ceaſe, yet the reſt, who ſhould be the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, might al obey one, who ſhuld ſuccede in Peters place.<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> By whoſe aſſured faith (becauſe Chriſt prayed for it) al they might be ſure not to erre in the faith.</p>

                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:2538:152"/> as S. Peter did to the Iewes, he did it by the office and nature of his Apoſtleſhip which was <hi>to goe into the whole worlde,</hi>

               <p>For the order, power and grace of their Apoſtleſhip was equal, as the degree and line of brethern is equall. But as God preferred in old time the eldeſt ſonne to the prieſthood,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 49</note> and to <hi>a greater power in gouernment,</hi> not by the force of the brotherhed, but by his own ordinance: euen ſo whereas Peter and Paule were equal Apoſtles, yet Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the appointment of Chriſt was the head, not by force of the Apoſtleſhip but by the will of God, to ſhew, that his Church was one, by hauing one pastour
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2538:152"/> in it aboue the reaſt, as a Kingdom is one, by hauing one King in it: or as a houſe is one, by hauing one master in it.</p>
               <p>Again if S. Paule did reproue S.

Paul might do it,<note place="margin">Galat. 2.</note> both becauſe they were fellowes and brethern in the Apoſtolike office, and alſo for that he had the ſame holie Ghoſt which Peter had. But we must conſyder (as Tertullian in his booke of preſcriptions doth witneſſe) that no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of S. Peters was then reproued as falſe,<note place="margin">Conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis fuit vitium, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.</note> but onlie his behauiour concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an outward fact of his, in that he hauing freelie eaten before with the Gentills without reſpect of keeping the Law of Moyſes, (wherein his deede was right good, and did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he belieued the obſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the olde Lawe to bind noman) yet at the comming of Iewes, he did

               <p>Likewiſe S. Auguſtine writeth: <hi>Neque enim negamus in hac ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia ſuiſſe ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Petrum,</hi>

Therefore he did not then teach Peter, what was true in that cauſe: but he reproued his diſsembling, whereby the Gentils were compelled to plaie the Iewes.</p>
               <p>So that wheras S. Peter was no leſſe perſwaded then S. Paul, that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ceremonies of the Law muſt ceaſe (as S.

               <p>For S.

               <p>And herein ſurely, S. Peter proued himſelf to be in deed the head of al the Apoſtles. For whereas Christ had ſaid: <hi>he that is greater among you,</hi>

               <p>By which wordes we perceiue that S. Cyprian did not iudge this reprouing

               <p>Conſider good Reader, how far theſe Fathers were from this minde of the Protestants, to witte, that the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of S. Peter by S. Paule, did anie thing withſtand his primacie, whereas thereby they (neuer doubting of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2538:155"/> in power) rather ſhew him to haue ben chiefe euery way, as well in grace, as in authoritie.</p>
               <p>S. Peter is reproued of S. Paule, and S. Peter praiſeth the verye ſame Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of S. Paule,<note place="margin">2.

Peter ſhewed to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour?</p>
               <p>Zuinglius reproued Luther, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his doctrine of the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But did Luther, trow you, praiſe Zuinglius for it? Except he praiſe a man, who doth excommunicate him, and pronounce him a Sacramentarie, and an heretike. And yet they were both brethern, and both apoſtles of this new Goſpell. But, ô Lorde, how farre of are they from the true Apostles?</p>

               <p>It is farther laid against the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of S.

               <p>I beſeche the diſcreete Reader nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vſe cauils himſelf, nor to geue care to them who loue to wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle. Here would M.

But I ſay there was beſide the Apoſtleſhip a kind of feeding ſo peculiar to Peter, that no Apoſtle toke (ſo ſpecially as S. Peter did) either the name thereof, or the thing meant by the name.</p>
               <p>Which thing the holy ſcripture doth inſinuate, when it ſheweth Peter to haue loued more then other, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie according to the meaſure of his loue to haue taken the meaſure of feeding. In which ſenſe Saint Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,

For who els were able to profeſſe this thing of himſelf? And becauſe he alone among all profeſſeth, <hi>he is preferred before all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First note well, that S. Ambroſe compareth the loue with the feeding. For he reaſoneth alwaies from the one
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2538:170"/> to the other.</p>
               <p>Secondlie he ſaieth, that Chriſt, in conſideration that he ſhoulde aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into heauen,<note place="margin">Vicare.</note> taught him, whome he left <hi>the Vicar of his loue.</hi> Behold if Peter be the Vicar of Chriſt, it is no wonder that the Pope ſitting in Peters chaire, is called alſo the Vicar of Christ. Yea but (ſay you) he is the Vicare of his loue, and not of his paſtoral office. Yeas Syr, of both.</p>
               <p>For now S. Ambroſe ſpeaketh of that loue, which conſiſted in hauing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to fede the flock. For it foloweth in S. Ambroſe: <hi>Sic enim habes,</hi> for thus thou readeſt. And immediatly he commeth to the power of feeding, which Chriſt gaue vnto Peter in the higheſt degree of any mortall pastour, becauſe Peter loued more then other. Christ left to vs a Vicar of his loue, who was that? Peter. when was he leaft a Vicar? When Chriſt ſaid, <hi>feede mie lambs.</hi> The loue then left to vs was
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2538:170"/> the power of feeding, which Peter had ouer vs, and the Vicar of Christes loue was the Vicare of Christes power, which he had to feede vs.</p>
               <p>Although Chriſt <hi>our euerlaſting meate</hi> fede vs alwayes by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> yet when he ſhould goe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porallie into heauen, he leaft vs a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of his corporall kinde of feeding.</p>
               <p>His woordes doe not nowe ſound in our eares, as they did whiles he liued, in preaching, in teaching, in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacraments, in gouerning the Churche, and in ſending other to preache. Chriſt hath a Vicar, whome to that effect he loueth aboue all other, and who loueth him aboue all other: to that effect, I ſaye, of feeding his flocke.</p>
               <p>Moreouer S. Ambroſe noteth, that Peter <hi>omnibus antefertur,</hi> is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before al, why ſo? <hi>Quia ſolus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitetur ex omnibus.</hi> Becauſe he alone of them al, doth profeſſe. But why ſaith
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2538:171"/> S. Ambroſe that he <hi>alone</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe? Might any other man profeſse, when Peter alone was aſked? No ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie. And ſo dooth S. Ambroſe meane, that Peter alone profeſseth his loue, becauſe he alone is aſked whether he loued more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe. otherwiſe if S. Iohn who ſtoode by, had ben aſked, I thinke he was not giltie of any lack of louing Chriſt. But Chriſt intended to geue vnto Peter more loue then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had, euen for this purpoſe, that he might receiue a higher power to feed, then other had.</p>
               <p>Laſt of al, S. Ambroſe noteth, as it were three degrees in the commiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Peters autority of feeding, and that, accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the power of feeding thriſe repeated.<note place="margin">Agnus.</note>

               <p>It is now alſo to be noted, that S. Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>broſe putteth the worde <hi>gubernare,</hi> to gouerne, in ſteed of <hi>paſcere,</hi> to feed. For in deed the ſhepheard hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to rule and gouerne his ſheepe.</p>
               <p>Peter then hath autority not only ouer the lambes, which are, as it were, the childern, and the vnlearned Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor only ouer the ſmaller ſheep, which yet are elder then the lambes (as the Chriſtian lawyers, the learned phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Iudges and Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom) but alſo he hath power to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern euen the ſheep which are of moſt perfit age.

               <p>No man is at this day, that which the Apostles were. No man is able to write vs an other Goſpel, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Canonical Epiſtles, or to war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant <hi>that he receiued the firſt fruits of the holy Ghoſt,</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Law, and the inſtitution of Chriſt for one cheefe Biſhop.</p>
               <p>And that this was the mind of all the auncient Fathers alſo, it appeareth moſt euidentlie, becauſe they geue ſuch a reaſon, whie the Church was built vpon S.

The which ſpirit of vnity
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2538:187"/> Chriſt gaue them, that his inſtitution (of twelue equall gouernours for the time) might wel appere not to be ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſe or hurtful vnto his Churche. For he would neuer haue ſent manie with equal authoritie into the whole world, except he had ben able to make them gouern with one minde, ſpirit, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hart.</p>
               <p>But ſeing it were ſtil a miraculouſe thing to ſee twelue, and much more to ſee manie thouſand biſshops and rulers, being al equal, ſtil to gouern the whole Church in their equal authoritie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſchiſme, (as the Apoſtles did) that Apoſtolike authority being only insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the better publiſhing of the faith, doth now ceaſe, and one ſhepherd is ordinarily alone ſet ouer al, by whoſe general power it may appere, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes Churche is but one.</p>

               <p>It is then euident, that theſe two Councels ſent their Decrees to the See Apoſtolike (as alſo all other Councels were wont to doe) according to the most auncient tradition: and that as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wel becauſe the See Apostolike was aſſured not to erre (as being the Rocke of the faith which was prayed for by Chriſt himſelfe) as alſo to th'intent all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Churches might receaue the ſoner that Decree, which were deriued to them

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2538:229"/> both to rule you whiles you conſulte, and to heare you when you pray.</p>
               <p>Two things are ſpecially to be noted in theſe words: one, <hi>that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Pope Innocentius is taken out of the authoritie of the holy ſcriptures,</hi> verily becauſe it maie be proued by the woorde of God, that the biſhop of Rome (who ſuccedeth S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is the highe ſhepheard, whoſe voice al the faithful are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to heare. The other point is, in that theſe Fathers affirm, <hi>that Chriſt ruleth the Pope at his conſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> alluding therein to the faith of S. Peter which was praied for,<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> to thend al his ſucceſſours might not erre in conſulting about matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>To which epistle pope Innocentius made anſwer, praiſing them, becauſe in doutfull matters they aſked him what ſentence or iudgement was to be follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Marke, that Innocentius douteth not to affirme, that the Fathers of the Councell of Miliuite (among whome Saint Augustine was) <hi>did know, that the whole worlde alwayes vſed to referre doutfull matters to the See Apoſtolike,</hi> and that (as it followeth) <hi>praeſertim quoties fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei ratio ventilatur,</hi> ſpecially ſo oft as the matter of faith is diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p>If anie man ſaie, that the Pope in dede wrote ſo, but that he ſaid not true: lette him conſyder, that Saint Auguſtine doth alſo acknowledge and praiſe the Popes anſwer in theſe words.<note place="margin">

               <p>We wrote to Pope Innocentius of bleſſed memorie. <hi>Ad omnia ille

               <p>What can be now required more?

Saint Augustine then doth confeſſe, that, <hi>from all quarters of the worlde the Pope of Rome was wont eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the old tyme</hi> to be conſulted, as being the general paſtour, whoſe duty it was, to prouide for the whole militant flocke, the particular biſhops them ſelues being compriſed therein.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:2538:231"/>
               <p>I haue ben ſomewhat long about S.

               <p>This diſcourſe of Conſtantine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth three thinges worthie to be noted.

Secondly he ſaieth, that <hi>they haue power to iudge euen of the Emperour himſelf.</hi> And this their power of iudging, dependeth of their power of prieſthod. For the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est power may iudge the lower. But no power can be higher then the power of a prieſt, becauſe he is the miniſter of God in that office which moſt directly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Gods honour and ſeruice.<note place="margin">Malac. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Wherupon S. Auguſtin hauing ſaid: <hi>what was Moyſes if he were not a prieſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Pſal. 98</note> geueth this reaſon of his words, <hi>Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quid maior Sacerdote eſſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat?</hi> Whether could he be greater then a prieſt? as who ſhould ſay: ſeing Moyſes was the greateſt officer amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iſraelits, and yet he could not be greater then a prieſt, it muſt nedes be, that he was a prieſt.</p>
               <p>The prieſtes then of God being the greateſt officers in earth haue power to iudge euen of an Emperour, if any be in their pariſhes or Dioceſes.</p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:2538:238"/>
               <p>Thirdly of theſe former points Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> deduceth an other concluſion. <hi>that prieſtes can not be iudged of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> How then can they be iudged of the Emperour? Neither doth it ſkill, that Conſtantine ſeemeth to haue iudged certaine prieſts, or Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, when the Donatiſts appealed vnto hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for he did it (as S.

               <p>Who aſketh leaue or pardon for that, which he may doe by his owne power? He did it then through the importunat ſute of heretickes, for the peace of the Church: otherwiſe deteſting them, that demaunded his iudgement after that the biſhoppes had iudged,<note place="margin">Optat. li <hi>2</hi> Auguſt. in epiſt. <hi>162.</hi>
                  </note> and finding great fault therewith himſelf, as Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus, and S. Augustine alſo doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But take away importunity of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, and the commiſsion, leaue or
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:2538:239"/> pardon of the right biſhoppes (who may for diuerſe reſpectes, either committe certain Eccleſiasticall cauſes to lay me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or winck for a tyme at ſuch iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts) take away, I ſay, hereſie and permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and ordinarily it is against the law of God, that any ſecular Prince (who needeth the office of a prieſt for his reconciliation vnto God) ſhould ſitte iudge vpon him in cauſes of the Churche,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>Now if one priest doe iudge an other, that is Gods iudgement,<note place="margin">Deut. 17. &amp; Num. 3</note> and not the iudgement of men. For God hath ſette one prieſt ouer an other, as the high prieſtes was aboue the Leuites in Moyſes lawe, and as the Apoſtles wereof a higher degree, then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty Diſciples, or then the ſeuen Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</p>

                  </note> yee (ô prieſtes of God) can not be iudged of men, are thus meant: the order of prieſthood is ſuch, as is not ſubiect to anie ſecular or earthly iuriſdiction. And ſeing all the power of iudgement, which euen Christian Emperours or Kinges haue by their own ſtate, is earthly and ſecular: it wil follow, that no King or Emperour can by his owne power iudge a prieſt in prieſtlie cauſes and in Eccleſiasticall matters.</p>
               <p>That all the power of Emperours, though they be Chriſtians, is ſecular, Constantine himſelf pronounceth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Donatiſts (as Optatus recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) <hi>Petitis á me in ſeculo iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi>

               <p>There are then two iudgements: one in the world, an other of Chriſt. That

               <p>But Christes iudgement (which he excerciſeth as wel preſently by his Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and Miniſters,<note place="margin">Ioan. 20.</note> as at the later day in his own perſon) is ſpirituall,<note place="margin">Spirital iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Matth. 16.

               <p>Againe, that Conſtantines iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was earthlye, S. Auguſtine in diuers places declareth: ſaing of the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry ſame Donatiſts:<note place="margin">In ep. <hi>162.</hi>

               <p>Hitherto I haue ſhewed, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine beleued and profeſſed, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Prieſtes are not (ordinarilie

                  <p>Which thing could not poſsiblie come to paſſe, except they were all directed by the God of peace, and by the ſpirit of vnity.</p>

                  <p>Neitheir can this matter be iuſtly coloured (as it is to them who periſh) by the example of the Apoſtles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.<note place="margin">hovv the Catholiks end their ſtrife.

                  <p>Againe, if the fact did towche in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny point the doctrine of the Goſpel, the one ſtraight waies yelded to the other,<note place="margin">Galat. 2.</note> as S. Peter did yeld vnto S. Paule, who reproued him for a diſſembling deede

                  <p>Thus the Catholiks alſo diſſent ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, either vpon a fact, as whether it be beſt to reduce the keeping of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſe to the ſhorteſt day in the yere or no (which is of no great importaunce) or els the one yeldeth to the other who reproueth him, if the matter be plaine: or if it be intricat, they both muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of damnation be content, to referre them ſelues to a viſible iudge in the earth, after whoſe determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their ſtrife is at an end, as it was euidently ſene in the matter of Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Mariages at Trent.

                  <p>But Luther being reproued of his brethern at many meetings, did euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſtand in this matter of faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the body of Christ was really preſent with the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of braed. Zuinglius on the otherſide, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued often tymes, yet died ſtubbornly in this opinion, that the body of Christ was preſent, not in truth, but in a ſigne and figure.</p>
                  <p>As it is certaine to vs, that neither of thoſe two is ſaued, ſo their faith muſt needes be monſtrouſe,<note place="margin">Note vvel.</note> who beleue that they both are ſaued. The contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not of a matter which as yet was hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or vnreuealed. For what in all the world ought to haue ben, or was more knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the ſupper of Chriſt?

                     <pb n="483" facs="tcp:2538:291"/> ſaid he was ſure of the truth, and bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his opinion moſt conſtantly. And ſhal now both he be ſaued, who teacheth ſtubbornly euen to death, that, <hi>in this ſacramental bread the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſtes</hi> body is preſent: and he alſo who teacheth ſtubbornly euen to death, that in this ſacramental bread, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſtes body is not preſent?</p>
                  <p>If both theſe preachers defended the truthe, what kinde of religion is this, where contradictory articles are true at once? If the one was a falſe teacher euen with ſtubburnes, he was therein a member of Antichriſt. And ſeing it muſt needes be, that the one did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouche falſe doctrine, and yet did war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it for the true Goſpel: we are ſure, that one of the two, muſt nedes be a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Antichrist. And yet ſeing the Popes Catholike doctrine doth diſſent from them both, which ſoeuer of two be an Antichriſt, the Pope ſhall not be thereby in any daunger to be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:2538:292"/> together with any of them.</p>
                  <p>Mark the reaſon wel. It goeth not to this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to that, wherin there is no end of contention. But it conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a neceſſary ſequele vpon a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed truthe.</p>
                  <p>If any man for falſe doctrine may be an enemy of Chriſt (as doutleſſe he may) he is that enemy, who teacheth moſt preſumptuouſly his falſe doctrine.

                  <p>Therefore ſeing Luther tawght ſtoutlie the one, and Zuinglius ſtoutly the other, either Luther or Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius is an aduerſarie of Christ.</p>

                  <p>And therefore the whole number of Protestants is condemned of God, for iustifying a falſe prophet, and for defending an euident member of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, as who teache euil to be good,<note place="margin">VVo to them, Iſai. 5.</note> and good to be euil.</p>
                  <p>To you I ſpeake, M.

I know you beleue his doctrine to be ſtarck falſe in that behalfe. Wel, was he not warned thereof, not onlie by his owne Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like biſshop, but alſo by Zuinglius a man of God, as you ſaie? Did he not after a ſharppe warning or two, yet ſtill defend his falſe doctrine manie yeeres togeather most ſtubburnlie?<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> Therefore by Saint Paules doctrine Luther was an heretike, and was to
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:2538:293"/> be auoided, as a man condemned by his own iudgement.</p>
                  <p>How do you auoid him, when in your Apologie of the Church of of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, you iuſtifie him, as a man whome God reiſed after long darknes, to geue freſh light vnto the world?

So did he, euen by your confeſsion. Did they ſtand in it being warned? So did he. Did they die in it? So did he. Made they a ſchiſm for it? So did he. Left they ſcholars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, who bare their names? As though the Martiniſts and Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, be not named of Martin Luther.

                  <p>To be ſhort, define an heretique for your life, how euer you can, and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhal be within the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of your definition.

                  <p>It wil not now ſerue to ſaie, that S. Cyprian died in his opinion of rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe, who were baptized of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:2538:298"/> not lawfully ſent at all.</p>
                  <p>As for temporall magiſtrates, who are onely ſheepe, and which can not preache themſelues, can much leſſe ſend others to preache.

                  </p>
                  <p>Which is directly to ſay, that the power
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:2538:300"/> of the Kinge is a higher and a greater power in Gods Church, then the power of a biſhop, or of a pastour. For as the lawiers know, and natural reaſon tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,<note place="margin">Lege. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; <hi>4.</hi> de Arbitris.</note>

                  <p>What is this to ſay, but onlie that the bodie is aboue the ſowle, the ciuill pollicy aboue the Church of Chriſt, and

                  <p>S. Luke then readeth, which cuppe, but Beza readeth,<note place="margin">Os impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</note> which blood is ſhed for you. Was there euer any like impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency heard of, as to correct the verie text of the holy Goſpel? But perhaps Beza did finde it ſo in ſome copies.

                  </p>
                  <p>What is then the matter, why Beza would nedes tranſlate it otherwiſe? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth S.

                  <p>To auoide this argument, Beza, who was at a point neuer to yeld in his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,

                  <p>First the participle (ſhed) in Greeke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> can not agree with nowne (blood) becauſe in Greeke the participle is the nominatiue caſe, and blood is the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue caſe.

                  <p>Againe, the participle may and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> muſt agree with the nown (cup) with whome it is of the ſame caſe, gender a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d number. why then doth Beza refer the participle to an other noune?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the participle can not be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="548" facs="tcp:2538:327"/> vnderſtanded of the wine: for wine was not ſhed for vs, and that Beza co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it can not be vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the material cup literally: for it can not be ſhed for vs, as being no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour, but gold, or ſyluer, or ſome like maſſy ſtuffe.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Wel, what followeth then? in truth it only followeth, that the cup is neither meant the matter and ſtuff of the cup, nor the wine which now is no more in the cup, but it is meant, <hi>the blood in the cup made of the wine.</hi> For ſo the word cup ſtandeth to ſignifie <hi>that which is in the cup,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 26. Marc. 14.</note> as all men know that haue common ſenſe: and that is in the cup, which Christ pronounced, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: this is my blood, &amp; cat.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Beza ſhould haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the fifth point,<note place="margin">The true ſenſe of S. Luke.</note> to wit, <hi>that the blood of Chriſt conteined ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:2538:327"/> preſent by changing the wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, is the new teſtament in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes blood, that is to ſay, it doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie vnto vs, that Chriſt by his bloodſhedding vpon the croſſe is our ſacrifice reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciling vs to God. The which blood ſo myſticallie conteined in the cup is ſhed for vs, becauſe the ſubſtance of that in the cuppe, and of that which is ſhed on the croſſe, is all one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the difference being onlie in the outward foorme, and not in the inward truthe.</hi> So that, whereas Chriſtes blood was really ſhed for vs on the croſſe in his owne foorme, that which is myſtically conteined in the cup vnder the foorme of wine, is the ſelf ſame blood, made alſo preſent after the ſort of a myſtical ſacrifice, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the truthe of Christes own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce made inuiſibly preſent, the great viſible ſacrifice openly made vppon the Croſse.</p>
                  <pb n="550" facs="tcp:2538:328"/>
                  <p>This only was the whole meaning of S. Luke, the which thing if Beza would not haue lerned of the catholik church, he ſhould haue learned it of S. Luke at the leaſt: for his woordes geue that ſenſe. But he would not learn it of S. Luke, becauſe he had hated it in the Catholike Churche, perhaps before he knew what S. Luke wrote. For theſe men profitte more by ſpite, then by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. They first choſe to forſake the Church, and then if any thing make for the ſame Church, be it epiſtle be it goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, it ſhall ſoner be falſe Greeke and falſe Latin to, then they wil come into the Church againe. I pray you, what a ſhameleſſe point is this, to teach <hi>that S. Luke wrote falſe Greeke,</hi> and did put the nominatiue caſe, in ſtede of the datiue caſe? well, therein Beza would not ſtand ouer longe. But he rather thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>keth, that the words (which is ſhed for you) are not at all of the Goſpel, but crept in, or were put in.</p>

                  <p>Thus in the old tyme, whereas the Apostles preached Christ to be true God and man,<note place="margin">VVHat the old hereticke deny.</note> Arrius denied his true Godhead, Marcion and Valentinus and Manicheus denied his true manhood, Apollinaris is denied his true ſowle, the Monothelits denied his doble will, the Donatiſts the Continuance of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality of his Church, the Pelagians the neceſsity of Gods grace, and the like may be ſaid of all other heretiks, whoſe opinions alwaies detracted ſome perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from Chriſt or from his Church.</p>
                  <p>Now I will ſhew, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants doe the like in our tyme. For whereas the vniuerſal Church, as wel by the preaching of the Apostles, as
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:2538:334"/> by the witneſſe of Gods writen word, was in poſſeſsion of a publike ſacrifice, of prieſthood, of ſeuen Sacramentes, as of moſt vndoubted instrumentes of grace, and of diuerſe other godly and diuine orders and Canons: haue they any other Goſpell, any other Churche, or any other doctrine, then that which conſiſteth in deniyng,<note place="margin">Hovv many things the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.

                  <p>The holy ſcriptures and Churche tawght, that a man being iuſtified, is both really deliuered from his ſynnes, and really receaueth faith, hoape, and charity. <hi>Thei deny our ſynnes to be taken away by the lamb of God, who came for that purpoſe,</hi> ſaying, they tary ſtill, but onely that they are not imputed.

                     </note> Which was the hereſie of the Pelagians: They deny the vſe of holy oyle and of chriſm. They deny the reall preſence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body, the adoration, and reſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, the tranſubstantiation of the bread into his body, the vnblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſacrifice of Chriſtes ſupper, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of one kinde to be ſufficient, and conſequently they deny, that whole Christ in vnder eche kinde, and the mingling of water with the wine.</p>
                  <p>And that one may receaue alone, that Aultars are lawfull, that there are Priestes of the newe Testament, that Biſhops are of any higher degree, then Priestes, that there is any one biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe chief of all other: that Priests can forgeue ſynnes, but onelie may preache that they are forgeuen: that
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:2538:335"/> it is lawfull to appoint certaine daies of fasting, or the abstinence from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain meates for obedience, although God both willed Adam to abſteine from a certain frute,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 2.</note> and the Iewes to abſteine from certain meates.
